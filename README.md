# TidalResponse3D
Placeholder for SSW Proposal

Temporary code in FreeFem++ 4.11 using Windows. No compatibility done for other OS and other FreeFem++ versions.
Calculates the gravity field of a given body and, assuming a shape close to a spheroid, calculates the static tidal displacement caused by a secondary body orbiting it using elastic deformations.
Currently only incompressible homogeneous body can be processed with this test example, but other versions may come soon without those hypothesis.
Non-spherical bodies will take much more time.
